# Batter

Remote Android phone management platform. View, control, and manage multiple Android devices from a web browser using low-latency H.264 video streaming over WebSocket.

## Features

- **Live video streaming** - Real-time H.264 video from Android devices via scrcpy, decoded in-browser with WebCodecs API
- **Touch & keyboard control** - Full remote control with touch, scroll, and keyboard input forwarding
- **Device grid** - Dashboard with live thumbnail previews for all connected devices
- **Adaptive quality** - Automatic thumbnail (360p/5fps) and full-quality (1024p/30fps) session tiers
- **Screenshot cache** - Cached last screenshot shown when devices are disconnected or sessions are idle
- **Device registration** - Guided wizard to register, validate, and probe device properties
- **Device groups** - Organize devices into groups with batch session start/stop, per-group access grants
- **Teams** - Group users into teams and grant team-level access to devices and device groups
- **User management** - Role-based access control (admin, operator, viewer) with expandable user cards, access overview, and password reset
- **RBAC** - Per-device, per-group, and per-team access permissions (view, control, manage) for non-admin users
- **Fully offline** - No external CDN, fonts, or scripts. The app works entirely without internet after deployment

## Deployment

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Linux host with USB ports (for connecting Android devices)
- One or more Android devices with **USB debugging** enabled

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XpertaDK/batter.git
cd batter
```

### Step 2: Set a secure JWT secret

Open `docker-compose.yml` and change the `JWT_SECRET` value to a random string (32+ characters):

```yaml
environment:
  JWT_SECRET: your-random-secret-here   # <-- change this
```

You can generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Step 3: Connect your Android devices

Plug in your Android device(s) via USB. Make sure USB debugging is enabled:

1. On the device, go to **Settings > About phone** and tap **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer Options
2. Go to **Settings > Developer options** and enable **USB debugging**
3. When prompted on the device, tap **Allow** to authorize the computer

Verify the devices are detected:

```bash
adb devices
```

### Step 4: Start Batter

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This builds and starts everything:

| Container | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **postgres** | PostgreSQL 16 database (data persisted in a Docker volume) |
| **batter** | Go backend (port 8080) + Next.js frontend (port 3000) |

Database migrations are applied automatically on first start.

### Step 5: Open the browser

Go to **http://localhost:3000**

On first launch, you'll see a setup screen to create your **admin account**. After that, you can:

1. Click **Add Device** to register your connected Android devices
2. Click a device card to start a live remote session
3. Create **groups**, **users**, and **teams** from the sidebar

### Stopping and restarting

```bash
# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Start again (data is preserved)
docker compose up -d

# Stop and delete all data (fresh start)
docker compose down -v
```

### Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Custom port

To change the frontend port (default 3000), update `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:8080"
  - "9000:3000"    # Access at http://localhost:9000
environment:
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS: http://localhost:9000
  FRONTEND_URL: http://localhost:9000
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `no devices found` after adding a device | Make sure USB debugging is enabled and the device authorized. Run `adb devices` on the host to verify. |
| Container can't see USB devices | The container needs `privileged: true` and `/dev/bus/usb` mounted (both are set in `docker-compose.yml`). |
| Database connection errors on startup | Wait a few seconds and retry — postgres needs time to initialize on first run. The healthcheck handles this automatically. |
| `JWT_SECRET: change-me-in-production` warning | Set a proper secret in `docker-compose.yml` (see Step 2). |

```
Browser (Next.js)  <--HTTP/WS-->  Go Backend  <--ADB/scrcpy-->  Android Devices
                                      |
                                  PostgreSQL
```

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Go 1.24, Gin, gorilla/websocket, pgx/v5 |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Streaming | scrcpy-server (H.264), WebCodecs VideoDecoder |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens), bcrypt |
